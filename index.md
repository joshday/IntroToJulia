# Sapir-Worf Hypothesis
- **Your language influences how you think.**
- In programming, your language influences how you solve problems.

# Why do we need another language?

- R is great for statistics
- Matlab is great for computational linear algebra
- Python is great for a little bit of everything

### However...
- All three have slow for-loops
- The best R/Python libraries are written in C/Fortran
- Matlab is closed source
- R is down to 6 people with commit access to base R
- They were designed without modern technologies which are now being shoehorned in

**How do these languages influence how you solve problems when for loops are "bad"?**

### Wouldn't it be great if we had a language which...
- Was open source
- Had an active community (743 contributors to base Julia as of Sep 25, 2018)
- Was fast (avoids two language problem)
- Had clear syntax (Easy to read and write)

# What is Julia?
> Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments

### Aims to solve the "two language problem"
- Prototype code goes into high-level language like Python, production code goes into low-level language like C++

### Write high-level, abstract code that closely resembles mathematical formulas
- yet produces fast, low-level machine code that has traditionally only been generated by static languages.

### Julia is more than just "Fast R" or "Fast Matlab"
- Performance comes from features that work well together.  
- You can't just take the magic dust that makes Julia fast and sprinkle it on [language of choice]

# Julia Features

- Type system
- Multiple dispatch
- Type Inference
- Metaprogramming (macros)
- Just-in-time (JIT) compilation using LLVM
- Clean, familiar syntax

## Multiple Dispatch is the Best Thing

# Basics

### The REPL

Your first experience with Julia will probably be via the REPL (read-eval-print-loop)

```julia; repl;
x = 1

y = 2
```

There are several **REPL Modes** that can be activated by certain characters:

- `?` (help)
- `]` (package manager)
- `;` (shell)
- `$` (R via [RCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl))

### Things have types

```julia; repl;
typeof(1)
typeof(1.0) 
typeof([1, 2])
```

### Code blocks use `end`

```julia
function f(x)
    x + 1
end
```

```julia
for i in 1:5
    println(i)
end
```

### Using Packages

```julia; repl;
using Distributions
g = Gamma(5, 1)
rand(g, 3)
mean(g), var(g), mode(g), pdf(g, 5)
```

**Note**: Multiple dispatch allows packages to be based around an "interface".  Compare this
to R, which has `rgamma`, `dgamma`, `pgamma`, etc.

In Julia, I know anything Distribution type will have a variety of methods available
rand(Normal()), pdf(Normal(), x), cdf(Normal(), x


# How do I do X in Julia?

1. `?X`
2. Official docs
3. Discourse/Slack
4. Google

# How should I write code?

- Jupyter
    - For reproducibility (see also [Weave.jl](https://github.com/mpastell/Weave.jl) and [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl)), sharing code with others, and working with data on a server.
    - **NOT** your main work environment
- Atom and VS Code have good Julia plug-ins (I use VS Code)
- Julia Pro (Atom with the Juno plug-in preinstalled)

# Reading and Writing

- Delimited Files
  
```julia;repl
using DelimitedFiles
x = randn(10)
writedlm("temp.csv", x, ',')
y = readdlm("temp.csv")
```

- (De)serialization

```julia;repl;
using Serialization
x = randn(10)
open(touch("temp")) do io
    serialize(io, x)
end
y = open(deserialize, "temp", "r")
```


# Linear Algebra

- 1-based indexing

```julia;repl;
x = rand(3, 3)
x[1]
x[end-1]
x * rand(3)
```
