# Sapir-Worf Hypothesis
- **Your language influences how you think.**
- In programming, your language influences how you solve problems.

# Why do we need another language?

- R is great for statistics
- Matlab is great for computational linear algebra
- Python is great for a little bit of everything

### However...
- All three have slow for-loops
- The best R/Python libraries are written in C/Fortran
- Matlab is closed source
- R is down to 6 people with commit access to base R
- They were designed without modern technologies which are now being shoehorned in

**How do these languages influence how you solve problems when for loops are "bad"?**

### Wouldn't it be great if we had a language which...
- Was open source
- Had an active community (621 contributors to base Julia)
- Was fast (avoids two language problem)
- Had clear syntax (Easy to read and write)

# What is Julia?
> Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments

### Aims to solve the "two language problem"
- Prototype code goes into high-level language like Python, production code goes into low-level language like C++

### Write high-level, abstract code that closely resembles mathematical formulas
- yet produces fast, low-level machine code that has traditionally only been generated by static languages.

### Julia is more than just "Fast R" or "Fast Matlab"
- Performance comes from features that work well together.  
- You can't just take the magic dust that makes Julia fast and sprinkle it on [language of choice]
